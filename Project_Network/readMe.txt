Before you open the server,there are some tips for you.

1. 
You must choose your own port number for the server.
for example, if you want to choose 9999 as the port number,you just need to enter the code below in the Terminal
./server 9999

2. 
To open the homepage of the local server,you should enter the address below using a browser(supposing the port is 9999)
http://localhost:9999/hompage.html

3. 
To open other files, you should change the address suffix
